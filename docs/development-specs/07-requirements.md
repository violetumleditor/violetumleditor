# 07 — Functional and non-functional requirements

Requirements written independently of the target. Each requirement has a stable identifier, an **origin** in the previous documents, and a verifiable **acceptance criterion**. Open decisions are marked **[DECISION]**.

Priorities: **M** = mandatory (parity or compatibility); **S** = desirable; **C** = to be decided.

## 6. Out of scope (proposed)

To be confirmed with the sponsor:
- Eclipse module (05, §3);
- JNLP and RPM modules (disabled);
- applet and peer-to-peer modes (dead code);
- Java and Python code export (not implemented);
- communication plugin (absent).

## 7. Delivery priority order

1. Reading and writing the format, on the corpus (FR-FIC-01 to 06, CA-01 to 04).
2. Editing the six diagrams: selection, addition, movement, drawing (FR-MOD, FR-EDT-01 to 07).
3. Undo and redo (FR-EDT-12, P-01).
4. PNG, PDF, clipboard and printing exports (FR-EXP).
5. Menus, shortcuts, auto-save, recent files (FR-UI, FR-FIC-07 to 09).
6. Internationalisation and preferences (FR-I18N, FR-PRF).
7. Themes and help (FR-UI-05, FR-UI-07).
8. Optional decisions (FR-WEB, FR-EXP-05, FR-I18N-04).
